# Lecture 7, Part 3 - Kinds of Animation:

There are several kinds of animation:

* **Animating UI View Properties** - Changing things like the frame and transparency. You can animate the changing of. This is the most common kind  of animation.
* **Animating Controller Transitions** - when transitioning from one view to another, e.g. by putting another card on the stack. We will not be covering that in the course. / This is like you're in the navigation controller and a new card comes on top of the deck. The animation of that sliding in of popping in or flipping in. That can be animated. (beyond the scope of this course)
* **OpenGL and Metal** - Underlying powerful animation framework - 3D animation. Sadly, also beyond the scope of this animation.
* **Sprite Kit** - "2.5D" Animation. Overlapping images moving around on top of one another, e.g. like Mario Bros, where you have images and they're overlapping to create what appears to kinda be a 3D
* **Dynamic Animation** - Physics based animation. You give the view a mass and a velocity and elasticity and then you operate on it. You push it, for example, and it'll just start flying across the screen. When you slide up from the bottom on your Iphone and it kind of bounces a little bit, that's a dynamic animation.  This, we actually will cover!
